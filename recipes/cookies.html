    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are perfect for those of us who love all things pumpkin pie and chocolate. These cake-like cookies are always a big hit. I think they taste best when they are cold from the refrigerator.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A cup of white sugar lends the perfect amount of sweetness. </li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, lends moisture without imparting flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds even more moisture and helps bind the dough together. </li>
        <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cookies rise. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Dissolving the baking soda in milk speeds up the leavening process. </li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the pumpkin chocolate chip cookie dough structure. </li>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon adds warmth to the sugary sweet cookies. </li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the cookie dough. </li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts:</strong> Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch. </li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate:</strong> You'll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> A dash of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li><strong>Pumpkin:</strong> Use store-bought canned pumpkin or homemade pumpkin puree. </li>
    </ul>
